Health checks
We have to have health check to ensure application is up and running before we are making any request to the applciation. 
There are two types of health checks
    1. Readiness probe - This will check if the service ready to accept any connections. There are multiple configs
        path - Health check path
        port - Port on which application is running
        initialDelaySeconds - Amount of time to wait before starting the health check
        periodSeconds - Interval at which health check has to be performed.
    If this probe fails, then the pod does not come up and READY status for kubectl get pods will be 0/1 instead of 1/1

    2. livenessProbe - This will help in restarting the pod if there are any anomolies in the pod.
        path - Health check path
        port - Port on which application is running
        initialDelaySeconds - Amount of time to wait before starting the health check
        periodSeconds - Interval at which health check has to be performed.
