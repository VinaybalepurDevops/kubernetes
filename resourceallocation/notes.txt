Create a name space called local

Specifying resource allocation

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: vote
spec:
    replicas: 20
    selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: vote
    template:
        metadata:
          name: vote
          labels:
            app: vote
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: vote
              image: dipesh017/demo:vote


The above specification creates 20 replicas on the ec2 instance, where there not be so much of resources avaialble. To avoid this
we spcecify the resources block.

Since each ec2 instance has a specified amount of storage and memory, we should ensure only reqiured number of pods are deployed
in the server. To achieve this we can use resources block.

resources:
    requests:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "1Gi"
    limits:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "2Gi"

requests block - ensures this amount of memory and cpu is blocked for the pod no matter what. 
limits block - is to limit the final allocation to only this much and not go beyond

Even though we have specified 20 replicas, it will create only 2 running replicas and keep the rest in pending state.

              resources:
                requests:

                    memory: "1Gi"
                limits:
                    cpu: "2"
                    memory: "2Gi"


Create a yaml called resource.yml and have the following specification
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: vote
spec:
    replicas: 20
    selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: vote
    template:
        metadata:
          name: vote
          labels:
            app: vote
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: vote
              image: dipesh017/demo:vote
              resources:
                requests:
                    cpu: "1"
                    memory: "1Gi"
                limits:
                    cpu: "2"
                    memory: "2Gi"
