Autoscaling
By default kubernets does not provide autosclaing. We need to install Kubernetes Metrics Server using 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/metrics-server.html

There are two levels of autoscaling - Pod and node

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
In Kubernetes, a HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically updates a workload resource (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet), 
with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand.
Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more Pods. 
This is different from vertical scaling, which for Kubernetes would mean assigning more resources 
(for example: memory or CPU) to the Pods that are already running for the workload.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: vote
spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: vote
    template:
        metadata:
          name: vote
          labels:
            app: vote
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: vote
              image: dipesh017/demo:vote
              resources:
                requests:
                    cpu: "1"
                    memory: "1Gi"
                limits:
                    cpu: "2"
                    memory: "2Gi"

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vote
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: vote

Create hpa.yml file with following config

apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
    name: hpa-deployment
spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        name: vote
    minReplicas: 1
    maxReplicas: 10 
    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 2


Run the hpa file using the command - kubectl apply -f hpa.yml -n local 
Check if the hpa is applied using - kubectl get hpa -n local
Run load on the dns url and check if the CPU utilization has increased beyond 2% using - kubectl get pods -n local
If the CPU increases beyond 2% then we will see increase in the pods. But since we have also defined resources on 
vote we will see only pods increasing to only 3.
